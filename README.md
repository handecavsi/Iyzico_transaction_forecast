# Iyzico_transaction_forecast

Iyzico is a financial technologies company that makes the online shopping experience easier for both buyers and sellers. It provides payment infrastructure for e-commerce companies, marketplaces and individual users. In this repo, total transaction volume was estimated on a merchant_id and daily basis for the last 3 months of 2020. This project provides the following benefits:

**Planning with Estimated Transaction Volume:** 
- E-commerce companies and marketplaces can predict future workloads using estimated transaction volume data and make operational planning accordingly. For example, more staff can be allocated or system capacity can be increased on busy workdays.

**Resource Management and Efficiency:**
- Forecasting throughput can help businesses manage their resources (human resources, warehouse stocks, technology infrastructure, etc.) efficiently. This can increase operational efficiency by reducing resource waste.

**Financial Planning and Budgeting:** 
- Forecast transaction volume is a valuable tool in the financial planning and budgeting processes. By taking projected revenues and expenses into account, businesses can create more accurate budgets for future periods and develop strategies to achieve their financial goals.

**Risk Management:** 
- Estimated transaction volume can help businesses determine their risk management strategies. For example, measures to be taken in case of an unexpected decrease or increase in transaction volume can be determined.

**Improving Customer Experience** 
- Accurately forecasting transaction volume can improve customer experience. For example, additional resources can be allocated or the capacity of customer services can be increased to prevent a decrease in service quality in case of unexpected congestion.

Supporting Decision Making Processes: Forecast transaction volume data can support strategic decision making processes for business owners and managers. Accurate predictions can enable more informed and effective decisions to be made.
